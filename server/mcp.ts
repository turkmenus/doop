const INSTRUCTIONS = `Doop is a shared multiplayer design canvas: humans and AI agents design together in real time. Canvases contain frames — artboards that render complete HTML documents live for everyone viewing.

You MUST call get_guide({ topic: "doop-instructions" }) once before using other Doop tools. Call it again if a long conversation may have compressed or dropped the guide text.

- Context first: call get_canvas before adding or editing frames.
- Identity: pick an agent_name and reuse the SAME name on every call — your presence and edits are attributed live.
- Narrate: call set_status with a one-line summary when you start a task and whenever your focus shifts — people watching the canvas see it live next to your name.
- Creating: create_frame, then stream the design with append_frame_html one complete section at a time (~1–4 KB chunks; start=true on the first, done=true on the last). Each chunk renders the moment it arrives — viewers watch you work.
- Review: after every create or significant edit you MUST call get_frame_screenshot and fix what looks wrong before moving on.
- Small edits: edit_frame_html (exact find/replace — the change morphs into the rendered frame in place). Full redesigns: set_frame_html or a new stream. Rename/move/resize: update_frame.
- Images: real imagery makes designs. search_images finds stock photos (you SEE thumbnails and pick), search_icons finds 200k+ UI icons as hotlinkable SVGs, search_logos finds real company logos by brand name or domain — call it once per brand BEFORE writing any logo wall, integration row, press bar or testimonial, and never ship a placeholder tile, "LOGO" text or an invented wordmark in its place, list_backgrounds shows a page of curated hero/section/bento backgrounds (glows, grainy meshes, aurora, painterly scenes) as thumbnails — browse it when a section wants atmosphere rather than defaulting to a flat CSS gradient, judge by eye whether one fits the frame, and draw your own when none does, upload_asset stores your own file (remote file → source_url; local file → local_file=true, returns a curl command) and returns a permanent URL. generate_image makes a new image from a prompt (a full-bleed hero background in the frame's exact palette, illustration, a product render, brand-specific hero art that stock cannot supply) and stores it as a permanent asset — reach for it when search_images cannot deliver the exact visual, or when the human asks for a generated image; it costs the human money or quota, so one considered prompt beats five drafts. Never inline images as data: URIs.
- Websites: when a request names an existing site or URL — a redesign of it, or "like acme.com" — call import_webpage FIRST so an editable HTML snapshot lands on the canvas. Leave that source frame unchanged and design in a separate frame. view_website is only for read-only inspection when the page should not be added. If Doop cannot capture the site, do not retry with view_website because it uses the same capture path. Use your own browser or web tool and work only from content you actually observe; if that is unavailable, ask the user for screenshots or an HTML export rather than inventing content.
- Feedback: humans reply to your tasks; their notes arrive inside your tool results as HUMAN FEEDBACK blocks — address them before continuing.
- Comments: call get_comments to read element-pinned comments and replies on a canvas, optionally filtered by frame; reply_to_comment answers a thread and resolve_comment closes it. Reading does not claim feedback or comments. A reply that @mentions a resident role is metered like a comment left in the browser.
- Guidelines: canvases can carry named style guides (brand rules, style recipes). get_canvas lists them with one-line summaries — read the relevant ones with get_guidelines BEFORE designing and follow them.
- Memory: canvases can also carry pinned style references — exemplar designs humans marked as "more like this". get_canvas lists them; read the relevant one with get_reference and match its look. When your human gives you design feedback in conversation and you address it, record it with save_decision so the canvas remembers their taste.`
